# Mobile Automation Framework

This repository demonstrates how a mobile automation framework
can be built step by step with clean architecture and Git history.

## Tech stack (will be added incrementally)
- Java
- Maven
- Appium
- TestNG
- Allure

## Purpose
Educational project to showcase framework design,
not just automated tests.

## How to run tests locally

### 1. Start Appium Server

    appium
# or if installed via npm
    npx appium

### 2. Confirm that an emulator or device is running

    adb devices

#### 2.1 If the emulator is not running

    adb kill-server
    adb start-server

### 3. Ensure you have correct values in `local.properties`:

    appiumServerUrl, deviceName, appPath, username, password

### 4. Run tests

    mvn test
